## Artificial Intelligence
#### Goals

##### Overview
The general concept of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is to build intelligent machines by teaching it through reading human behavior. The foundational goal of AI is to design a technology that enables computer systems to work intelligently yet independently. There are 7 goals that are used when creating AI that I listed below:

  1. Develop problem-solving ability
  2. Incorporate knowledge representation
  3. Facilitate planning
  4. Allow continuous learning
  5. Encourage social Intelligence
  6. Promote creativity
  7. Achieve general intelligence
  
##### 1. Develop Problem-Solving Ability
Since the beginning of computing, developers have worked to create AI that use human step-by-step instructions to solve common problems or tasks. It has since grown to having the AI learn from the basic steps to improving and solving more complex puzzles, like finding the fastest route to predicting the stock market.

##### 2. Incorporate Knowledge Representation
AI learning revolves around the knowledge representation of ‘what is known’ to the AI. With a set of objects, relations, and concepts, the representation reveals information to the computer to use to solve problems. Examples would include AI diagnosing a medical condition or mimicking human interaction.
##### 3. Facilitate Planning
Some AI is used to envision the future. With AI-driven planning, it helps determine a procedural course of action to achieve its goals. It also helps optimize overall performance through epredictive analytics, data analysis, forecasting, and optimization models.

##### 4. Allow Continuous Learning
Learning is fundamental to AI solutions. With the ability to improve its’ knowledge through computer algorithms, AI programs can process optimized procedures through observations and past experiences.
##### 5. Encourage Social Intelligence
Affective computing is an additional branch of AI that recognizes and simulates human emotions, otherwise known as ‘Emotion AI’. Emotion AI can allow computers to read facial expressions, body languages, and voice tones to interact at a human level. 
##### 6. Promote Creativity
One field of AI focuses on creativity theoretically and practically. It can help humans accomplish tasks by providing options and alternatives. 
##### 7.  Achieve General Intelligence
A branch of AI allows researchers to develop machines with general AI capabilities. This allows machines to combine all the cognitive skills of humans and perform tasks with proficiency than humans; boosting overall productivity for completing tasks.
