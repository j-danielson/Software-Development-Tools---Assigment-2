## Artificial Intelligence
#### Definition

According to a very interesting article[^2] I came accross, by definition, Artificial Intelligence is software written to perform a determined task imitating the human thought process by design. Think of a simple piece of facial recognition software program that might detect faces in photographs by looking for patterns just like we would when we look at different faces. We can take into account that pretty much all human faces share certain features. Our eye sockets and mouth usually present as darker, while our forehead, cheekbones, nose and chin form raised areas instead.

Everybody's facial features are in roughly the same place, so we can assume it's a good pattern to look for when trying to differentiate between faces. A more complex facial recognition system could be able to recognize specific faces by measuring the distance between and the size of identifiable features.

An system even smarter might record every face passing by it's cameras to create a database of faces before labeling individuals and starting to track behaviour. In this hypothethical case, if 99% of the individuals detected by an AI system use a building's doors between 7am and 6pm, then an individual trying to use the doors at 3am might be worth reporting to security. 

AI has massive potential, there is simply no doubt. As we have discussed above, processing power and software complexity offers opportunity to create increasingly complex behaviour and problem solving, incresaing our ability to maximize the use of our resources in the quest of making our life much easier. With AI we could get closer to worrying less about menial things, although some also argue it might be apporiate to worry about it getting out of control.

Professor Stephen Hawkins was very particular about his take on AI. [^1]

An example I'm sure we all can think of:

AI, what could possibly go wrong.

Judging by the nature of their purpose, theres two main AI branches - narrow and general. 

Narrow AI is the ability of software - sometimes in conjunction with hardware sensors and mechanisms - to dynamically perform an otherwise narrowly-defined task that is simple for humans but difficult for autonomous machines. Self-driving cars would be an example of narrow AI.

General AI would be artificial beings, conscious of themselves and able to undertake a wide spectrum of general tasks they decide upon under changing circumstances, in the same sense that humans do.

> Narrow AI can be analogized as artificial animals, while general AI can be thought of as artificial people (regardless of what their
